### Why is Fusang Exchange Ltd migrating its clients to Block Tree Ltd?

Fusang Exchange is changing its focus to serve regulated financial institutions exclusively, similar to traditional stock exchanges. As a result, access by individual investors will only be possible through one of our Exchange Members. In order to continue to serve our existing clients, Fusang Exchange has decided to move all individual clients to Block Tree Ltd, an associated member of the Fusang Group and a broker member of Fusang Exchange.

### Is Block Tree Ltd regulated?

Yes. Block Tree is a licensed fund management company and is regulated by the Labuan Financial Services Authority.

### Do I have to agree to the migration, or is it mandatory?

The migration to Block Tree is a mandatory process for all clients to ensure compliance with regulatory requirements and to maintain the integrity and security of your assets and data. However, should you request for a further migration from Block Tree to another broker member within the Fusang Exchange network, that is possible when your desired broker joins us as an Exchange Member. Alternatively, you may also choose to move all your holdings to another service provider even before the migration takes place.
