## Why is Fusang Exchange Ltd migrating its clients to Block Tree Ltd?

Fusang Exchange is changing its focus to serve regulated financial institutions exclusively, similar to traditional stock exchanges. As a result, access by individual investors will only be possible through one of our Exchange Members. In order to continue to serve our existing clients, Fusang Exchange has decided to move all individual clients to Block Tree Ltd, an associated member of the Fusang Group and a broker member of Fusang Exchange.

## Is Block Tree Ltd regulated?
Yes. Block Tree is a licensed fund management company and is regulated by the Labuan Financial Services Authority.

## Do I have to agree to the migration, or is it mandatory?

The migration to Block Tree is a mandatory process for all clients to ensure compliance with regulatory requirements and to maintain the integrity and security of your assets and data. However, should you request for a further migration from Block Tree to another broker member within the Fusang Exchange network, that is possible when your desired broker joins us as an Exchange Member. Alternatively, you may also choose to move all your holdings to another service provider even before the migration takes place.

## What will happen if I do not consent to the migration?

While we encourage our clients to consent for a smooth transition, in case of disagreement, your assets will still be safeguarded by us. However, they will be treated as unclaimed assets and custodised in segregate wallets in accordance with regulatory requirements.

## How will my personal information and assets be secured during the migration process?

Your personal information and assets will be securely protected throughout the migration process. We have implemented robust security measures and encryption protocols to safeguard your data and assets, ensuring compliance with all relevant legal and regulatory requirements.

## How long do I have to effect this move? 

You will have time to respond till 11 December 2023, after which your account balances will be moved to an unclaimed asset pool, and your account with Fusang Exchange will be deactivated. Should you wish to move your balances (not FSC tokens) to another third-party wallet please contact support@fusang.co.
